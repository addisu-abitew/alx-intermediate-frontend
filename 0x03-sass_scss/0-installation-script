# Steps to Install Node.js 20.16 and SASS on Ubuntu

1. **Install NVM (Node Version Manager)**
   Run the following command in the terminal to install NVM:

   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. **Restart the Terminal**
   Exit the current terminal session:

   ```bash
   exit
   ```

   Then reopen the terminal to apply NVM changes.

3. **Install Node.js Version 20.16 Using NVM**

   ```bash
   nvm install 20.16
   nvm use 20.16
   ```

   Confirm installation:

   ```bash
   node -v
   # Should output: v20.16.x
   ```

4. **Install SASS (Optional Step)**
   With Node.js installed, run:

   ```bash
   npm install sass -v 3.7.4
   ```

   Verify installation:

   ```bash
   npx sass --version
   ```

# Notes

* NVM allows you to switch between multiple Node.js versions easily.
* SASS is a CSS preprocessor used for styling web applications.
